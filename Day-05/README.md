# Maze

The solution itself is pretty straigt-forward. But I guess, bad timing to use a recursion ^^. Part Two takes several minutes, so I just did a couple of python-code ( my first :) ) which is done in couple of seconds.

## Task One

+ with `php` and with a recursive function

## Task Two

+ i guess the php solution also works, but didn't run it so long
+ did a python solution with a basic loop
